            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="about-content"> <img src="images/portrait.jpg" alt="Me, a Software Developer" class="profile-img">
                <p>I started my journey with technology young, instantly hooked as a child by the limitless knowledge available on the internet.
                    Throughout the years, I tried my hand at several fields within the software space, including 3D Modeling, Digital Music Production, and Game Development.
                    But there's one common thread between these interests that motivated me to choose the career of Computer Science: The Computer!
                </p> <br/><p>
                    Upon this revelation, I enrolled in CS courses at my local community college and made it my mission to understand as much as I could about what's 'under the hood' of these machines.
                    This led me to the Java coding language, where I learned a majority of my skills as a software developer. But it didn't stop there.
                    SQL, No-SQL, Cloud, Git, CI/CD, IOT, Web Frameworks, just about everything I could get my hands on, I studied deeply.
                </p> <br/>
                <p> 
                    Through this exposure to a vast array of modern technologies, I settled on my favorite part: The Backend. While I appreciate the
                    creativity and intuition that goes into being a UI/UX designer, the most interesting part of an application to me is it's integration with outside resources.
                    Whether it's the usage of an external API, or inclusion of a data source, I wanted to focus on the details of these interactions in software the most.
                </p> <br/>
                <p>
                    And that's my story! I hold a strong belief that the best applications are those which help people accomplish their goals quicker and more effectively. My ultimate career objective
                    is to author or contribute to code which does exactly that.
